This is a famous board game that we used to play in our childhood commonly known as "criss-cross" across India.

Description:
> It's a game of two players.
> There a a total of 9 cells on the board.
> One of the player choose either "X" or "O" as his/her choice that is to be filled in the cell.
> Other player is alloted with the left choice from first player to be filled in the cell.

Rules:
1. Each player get his/her chance to fill the cell one at a time with his/her selected choice.
2. Once cells are filled with a particular choice of player either horizontally or vertically or diagonally, Then the player associated with that choice wins the particular round.
3. If all the cells are filled by both the players and Rule No.2 is not fulfilled then the particular round ends up with draw.
